# toDoApplication
A dummy node js application to be used to deploy on aws.
This is my first experience with node js, mongoDB and AWS. So I am trying to deploy this node application on an EC2 instance and trying to connect to cloud hosted mongoDB on ATLAS and create and access a database in my mongoDB cluster.
